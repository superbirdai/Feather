# Feather
is a lightweight client for ChatGPT, with support for other AIs such as Google Gemini in the future.

## Setup
First, clone the repository, and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the components needed (you can also make a virtual environment, although the components shouldn't cause any conflicts in your system), then, put your API keys in the `privkey.py`, then run the `client.py` file.
